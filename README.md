## 🔍 Key Features

Deeptrail packs a powerful set of tools for crypto traders to enhance their market awareness and stay ahead of hidden threats.

### 🌍 Risk Heat Map  
AI-generated visual heatmaps that highlight high-risk zones based on on-chain anomalies and behavioral patterns.  
Identify clusters of manipulation, scam activity, and unusual movement in real time.

### 🔗 Digital Trails  
Follow the journey of tokens across wallets and platforms.  
Deeptrail uses the DexScreener API to reconstruct token flows, making suspicious transfers easy to trace.
### 👤 Phantom Fingerprint  
A custom scoring system that evaluates the trust level of a token based on traceable historical data.  
Factors include minting behavior, LP actions, whale entries, and early wallet activity.



### 🕵️‍♂️ D-Sync Scan  
Scan any token address to receive instant, AI-supported insights.  
Detects red flags like bot farming, ownership loopholes, and suspicious contract traits — before they become threats.

## 🔍 Key Features

Deeptrail packs a powerful set of tools for crypto traders to enhance their market awareness and stay ahead of hidden threats.

### 🌍 Risk Heat Map  
AI-generated visual heatmaps that highlight high-risk zones based on on-chain anomalies and behavioral patterns.  
Identify clusters of manipulation, scam activity, and unusual movement in real time.

### 🔗 Digital Trails  
Follow the journey of tokens across wallets and platforms.  
Deeptrail uses the DexScreener API to reconstruct token flows, making suspicious transfers easy to trace.
### 👤 Phantom Fingerprint  
A custom scoring system that evaluates the trust level of a token based on traceable historical data.  
Factors include minting behavior, LP actions, whale entries, and early wallet activity.



### 🕵️‍♂️ D-Sync Scan  
Scan any token address to receive instant, AI-supported insights.  
Detects red flags like bot farming, ownership loopholes, and suspicious contract traits — before they become threats.

## 🗺️ Roadmap – The Path Forward

Deeptrail is built in evolutionary phases — each expanding its trace capabilities and threat detection depth.

### ✅ Phase 1: MVP (Done)  
**Status:** Released Q3 2025  
Foundational trace intelligence now live.

- 🧭 **Digital Trails Engine** — track token behavior across wallet hops  
- 🧠 **Phantom Fingerprint** — detect wallet patterns and spoofing  
- 🕸️ **D-Sync Scan** — identify sync-based exploits and silent loops  
- 🌡️ **Risk Heat Map** — visual trace-level risk indicators  
- 🔗 **API Hook** — enrich on-chain trace data
- 🧬 **$DEEP Token Access Logic**

### 🟣 Phase 2: In Progress (Active)  
**ETA:** Q4 2025  
Enhancing signal depth and cross-chain vision.

- 🔁 **Multi-chain Support** — BSC integration  
- 📡 **Live Alerts** — real-time suspicious token activity  
- 🔐 **Discord-Based TraceKey System**  
- ⚙️ **Signal Filter Settings** — user-defined anomaly thresholds  
- 📌 **Expanded Role Sync System**

### 🔴 Phase 3: Upcoming (Planned)  
**ETA:** Q4 2025 – Q1 2026  
AI-powered trace intelligence enters the field.

- 🧠 **AI Trust Score** — adaptive scoring per token  
- 🕰️ **Blockchain Time Sync** — improve accuracy in loop detection  
- 🧬 **Predictive Threat Mapping** — emerging trace behaviors

## 🔧 **Tech Stack**

- **DexScreener / Birdeye / Streamflow API** — Used for token movement tracking.
- **JavaScript / HTML / CSS** — For building the Chrome extension UI.
- **REST APIs / GraphQL** — For external service integrations.
- **WebSockets** — For real-time data updates.
- **TensorFlow** — For AI-based pattern detection.

## 📈 **Formulas for MVP Features**

### **1. Risk Heat Map** 🔥

- **Smart Logic**: Calculates the **risk score** of tokens based on the historical data, including volume changes, price swings, and transactions.
```javascript
function calculateRiskHeatMap(tokenData) {
  const riskFactor = (tokenData.volumeChange + tokenData.priceChange) / tokenData.averagePrice;
  return riskFactor > 0.5 ? "High Risk" : "Low Risk";
}
```
Where:
volumeChange: Change in the token's trading volume.
priceChange: Price change compared to the previous trading period.
averagePrice: Average token price over a specified period.

2. Digital Trails 🛤️
Smart Logic: Tracks the movement history of a specific token using the DexScreener API.

```python
import requests

def track_token_movement(token_address):
    url = f"https://api.dexscreener.com/token/{token_address}"
    response = requests.get(url)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        return data.get("tokenMovementHistory", [])
    else:
        print(f"Error fetching data: {response.status_code}")
        return []
```
Where:
tokenAddress: The address of the token being tracked.
tokenMovementHistory: A history of token movements retrieved from DexScreener.

3. Phantom Fingerprint 👻
Smart Logic: Scores tokens based on the frequency and nature of traceable activities associated with the token.

```javascript
function calculateFingerprintScore(tokenData) {
  const score = (tokenData.transactionCount / tokenData.totalAddresses) * 100;
  return score > 75 ? "High Trust" : "Low Trust";
}
```
Where:
transactionCount: Number of transactions involving the token.
totalAddresses: Number of unique addresses interacting with the token.

## 📈 **Formulas for MVP Features**

### **1. Risk Heat Map** 🔥

- **Smart Logic**: Calculates the **risk score** of tokens based on the historical data, including volume changes, price swings, and transactions.
```javascript
function calculateRiskHeatMap(tokenData) {
  const riskFactor = (tokenData.volumeChange + tokenData.priceChange) / tokenData.averagePrice;
  return riskFactor > 0.5 ? "High Risk" : "Low Risk";
}
```
Where:
volumeChange: Change in the token's trading volume.
priceChange: Price change compared to the previous trading period.
averagePrice: Average token price over a specified period.

2. Digital Trails 🛤️
Smart Logic: Tracks the movement history of a specific token using the DexScreener API.

```javascript
function trackTokenMovement(tokenAddress) {
  return fetch(`https://api.dexscreener.com/token/${tokenAddress}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      return data.tokenMovementHistory;
    });
}
```
Where:
tokenAddress: The address of the token being tracked.
tokenMovementHistory: A history of token movements retrieved from DexScreener.

3. Phantom Fingerprint 👻
Smart Logic: Scores tokens based on the frequency and nature of traceable activities associated with the token.

```javascript
function calculateFingerprintScore(tokenData) {
  const score = (tokenData.transactionCount / tokenData.totalAddresses) * 100;
  return score > 75 ? "High Trust" : "Low Trust";
}
```
Where:
transactionCount: Number of transactions involving the token.
totalAddresses: Number of unique addresses interacting with the token.
